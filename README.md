# Astrophotography Image Enhancement

### Project Description:
#### Summary - Astrophotography processing using the specified techniques enhances star clarity, reduces noise, and improves image contrast effectively:

Star and Noise Sharpening (High-Pass Filtering in the Frequency Domain):
This technique enhances the visibility of stars and fine details by isolating high-frequency components, which correspond to sharp transitions in the image. It boosts the sharpness of celestial objects while suppressing smoother, low-frequency areas like the background.

Noise Removal (Median Filtering):
Median filtering is ideal for removing salt-and-pepper noise and preserving edges. By replacing each pixel with the median of its neighborhood, it reduces random noise while maintaining star boundaries and other detailed structures.

Contrast Enhancement (imadjust/Contrast Stretching):
Contrast stretching redistributes intensity values to span the full dynamic range, improving the visibility of faint details in darker regions while preserving the brightness of stars. This technique enhances image clarity and highlights important structures.

Combined Effect:
These techniques collectively enhance the aesthetic and scientific value of astrophotography by producing sharper, noise-free, and visually striking images with improved detail and contrast.
