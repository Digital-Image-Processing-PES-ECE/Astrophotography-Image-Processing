# Astrophotography Image Enhancement

### Project Description:
#### Summary - Astrophotography image processing enhances the quality of deep-sky images by refining their color, detail, and clarity. The workflow typically includes:

Preprocessing: Calibration using dark frames, flat frames, and bias frames to remove sensor noise and optical artifacts.
Alignment and Stacking: Combining multiple images to reduce noise and improve signal-to-noise ratio.
Postprocessing: Techniques like color balancing, noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and sharpening to highlight details like nebulae or galaxies.
Advanced Methods: Applying filters, wavelet transforms, and AI-based tools for finer detail extraction and noise suppression.

#### Course concepts used - 
1. -  Star and noise sharpening using high-pass filtering in the frequency domain 
2. -  Noise Removal by using Median Filtering technique 
3. -  Contrast Enhancement using imadjust (Contrast Stretching)
   
#### Additional concepts used -
1. -Image Deblurring using Lucy-Richardson Algorithm
   
#### Dataset - 
Link and/or Explanation if generated

#### Novelty -
